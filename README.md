# API-INTEGRATION

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT.LTD

*NAME*: SRI GURUDHARSHINI.R

*INTERN ID*: CT04DY2191

*DOMAIN*: FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

*TASK OVERVIEW*

This project is developed as part of the CODTECH Internship Program (Task 1: API Integration).
The objective of this task is to create a responsive and interactive webpage that fetches and displays data from a public API dynamically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to demonstrate a basic understanding of web technologies and show how API data can be integrated into a frontend application.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a key component of modern web development. They allow applications to communicate with external services and access live data without storing it locally. In this project, I have used a free public API to fetch and display real-time information on a web page.

*PROJECT TITLE*

Random Cat Facts - API Integration Webpage

*DESCRIPTION*

This project displays random cat facts fetched from the public API Cat Facts API (https://catfact.ninja/fact).
When the user clicks the “Get New Fact” button, the webpage makes an asynchronous API call using JavaScript’s fetch() method, retrieves a random cat fact in JSON format, and displays it instantly on the page without reloading.

The design is simple, modern, and mobile-friendly. The webpage layout is styled with CSS to make it visually appealing and responsive on all screen sizes. It also includes error handling in case the API request fails, showing a user-friendly error message.

This project effectively demonstrates the concept of asynchronous programming, API integration, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript — all essential skills for modern web developers.

*TECHNOLOGIES USED*

-->HTML5 – Structure of the webpage
-->CSS3 – Styling and responsiveness
-->JavaScript (Fetch API) – For API integration and dynamic content loading
-->Fetch API – for handling API requests and responses

*PUBLIC API USED*

API Name: Cat Facts API

Endpoint: https://catfact.ninja/fact

Description: Provides random cat facts in JSON format.

Authentication: No API key required (free and open).

*FEATURES*

1.Fetches random facts dynamically from an external API.
2.Displays results without refreshing the page.
3.Clean and minimal UI with smooth button interaction.
4.Fully responsive and mobile-friendly design.
5.Error handling for failed API calls.

*HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT*

STEP1: Download or clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/API_Integration_Task.git

STEP2: Open the project folder in VS Code or any text editor.

STEP3: Open index.html in your browser.

STEP4: Click the “Get New Fact” button to load a random cat fact.

*OUTCOME*

By completing this project, I successfully developed a responsive web application that integrates a public API using core web technologies.
This project strengthened my understanding of API handling, asynchronous JavaScript, and frontend development principles. It also reflects my ability to design user-friendly web interfaces and implement real-time data fetching functionality.

Overall, this task helped me gain practical experience in connecting frontend applications with live APIs, which is a fundamental skill in today’s web development world.
